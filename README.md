All the weekly tasks for the GMIT module Programming for Cybersecurity.

All the code in this repository was done on Microsoft Visual Studio.

<h2><b>Task #1: bmi.py</b></h2>

<b>Task:</b>

<i>Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI).</br>
The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms.</br>
The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.</br>

$ python bmi.py</br>
Enter weight: 65</br>
Enter height: 180</br>
BMI is 20.06.</br></i>

<b>Solution:</b>
Running the programing will ask the user to enter their height in centimetres. Next, it will ask the user to enter their weight in kilograms. The program then calculates the BMI number from the user's input and displays a message to give the user their BMI number and also their weight range. I used a BMI calculator that I found through Google as a reference when making the program so that I was certain the calculations where correct and that I was getting the same BMI number in my program as the website's BMI calculator. I also used it to add an extra feature to my program to give the user their weight range based on what their BMI number is so for example, if the user was given a BMI number of less than 18.5 then the user is classified as Underweight, if it's greater than 18.5 but less than 24.9 then the user is classified as Healty, if it's greater than 24.9 but less than 29.9 then the user is classified as Overweight and if it is greater than 29.9 than the user is classified as Overweight. While it may not have been necessary to complete the task, I thought I should add it in as an extra feature.
